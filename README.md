# MandelBrot_and_Julia_sets_visualisation
I worked on this project from 14/09/2023 to 16/09/2023, it was quite small and simple as the goal was to plot the Mandelbrot set. 
One must consider that this project becomes much harder if the addition of a zooming (user friendly, and not just asking the user to
input values) something which I was not able to implement. 
This project taught me a bit of PIL (in my failed attempts at making a colormesh) and Matplotlib but most of the graphing code was copied from the internet as I had never plot in such manner before, I hope to pursure more complicated plotting projects where maybe the computational skills required are higher ( iterating through z**2 + c is simple enough) and hence they overshadow the plotting capabilities, which was not a characteristic of this project
