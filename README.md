# MandelBrot_and_Julia_sets_visualisation
My first project, I started on 14/09/2023 and it was quite small and simple as the goal was to plot the Mandelbrot set. 
This project taught me a bit of PIL (in my failed attempts at making a colormesh) and Matplotlib.
I hope to pursure more complicated plotting projects where maybe the computational skills required are higher (iterating through z**2 + c is simple enough) a
nd hence they overshadow the plotting capabilities, which was not a characteristic of this project.
